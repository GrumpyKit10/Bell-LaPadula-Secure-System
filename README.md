# Bell-LaPadula-Secure-System
This project implements a secure system using the Bell-LaPadula model, enforcing read/write rules and strong tranquility. Subjects and objects hold names and values, while a Reference Monitor manages security levels and mediates all access. Commands from an input file are validated, executed if allowed, and reported as Bad Instructions if invalid.
